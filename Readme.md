Automatic Figure Saving and Automatic Figure Add in Ansys Mechanical

Through these code snippets, it will help reduce the time spent on model preparation and reporting processes in finite elements studies.

In our first code running in Spaceclaim program, we prepare 2D models with many holes to easily achieve high-quality mesh effortlessly.

Then, in Ansys Mechanical, thanks to our code, we automatically add figures for the analysis. Here, we can adjust figures appearance for different coordinates if we want, or we can manually edit it.

In the next step, run second code to create automatic figure saving.

This code has the following main features:

1. It works for multiple analyses. For example (Static Structural and Modal)
2. Foldering of Ansys Mechanical results and analysis sections is automatically created in the location you choose in Windows.
